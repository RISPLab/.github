### Welcome to `CCENET` 👋

**`CCENET`** is a network for climate change economists who try to find feasible solutions for climate change from a network/linkage perspective.

**`CCENET`** members are working together on:

>- 🌐 Developing new theories of economics from a network perspective
>- 🌍 Developing BRIDGE series models that bridge different natural and economic systems
>- 🔄 Modeling the propagation of shocks on economic networks

>- 🤖 Exploring machine learning potential for climate change risk assessment
>- 🏭 Developing methodologies for companies, investors, and insurers to calculate greenhouse gas emissions across value chains
>- ⚡ Developing methodologies for companies, investors, and insurers to assess the climate-related financial risks - both physical and transition risks - facing their sector.

>- 💡 Exploring how machine learning can help tackle climate change
>- 🤔 ...
